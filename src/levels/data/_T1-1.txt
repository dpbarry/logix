info=<p class="italic"> It’s 2271. Matrices all over the world have begun losing their values. It is up to you, the last remaining logician, to put them back together. </p><hr> <p class=""> A <b> matrix </b> is the mathematical analogue of a table. In every level, you will be presented with a grid representing an incomplete matrix. Each <b>entry</b> of that matrix can be referenced via its row and column. Logix uses the notation \( [i,j] \) to represent the entry at the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column of the current level’s matrix.</p><p class=""> The numbered buttons below the grid correspond to the only values with which you can complete the matrix (the <b>domain</b>). </p>  <p class=""> A <b> proposition </b> is denoted by a true or false statement, e.g. “Julius Caesar is alive” or \([3,2] = 1\). They are the clues from which you can derive the missing entries. For now, the given propositions will always be true.</p>                <p class="">  Access this and future info pages in the top right.</p>
