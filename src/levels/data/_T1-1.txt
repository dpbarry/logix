info= <p class="italic"> It’s 2271. Matrices all over the world have begun losing their values. It is up to you, the last remaining logician, to put them back together. </p><hr> <p class=""> A <b> matrix </b> is the mathematical analogue of a table. In every level, you will be presented with a grid representing a partially filled-in matrix. Each <b>entry</b> of the matrix can be referenced via its row and column, which are labelled outside the grid. Logix uses the notation \( \lang \begin{smallmatrix} i \\ j \end{smallmatrix} \rang \) to represent the entry at the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column of the level’s matrix.</p><p class=""> The numbered buttons represent the only values with which you can complete the matrix; they comprise the <b>domain</b>. </p>  <p class=""> A <b> proposition </b> is a true or false statement, e.g. “Julius Caesar is alive” or \(\htmlClass{entrystyle}{\lang \begin{smallmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{smallmatrix} \rang} = 1\). They are the clues from which you can derive the missing entries. For now, the given propositions will always be true. You can click on an entry in a proposition to jump to the corresponding cell in the matrix.</p>                <p class="">  Access this and future info pages in the top right.</p>
