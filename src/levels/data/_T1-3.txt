info=<p>Equivalence isnâ€™t the only arithmetic predicate at our disposal. Entries can also be described in the ways that they differ from one another. To avoid getting lost in the the weeds, consider entering <b> candidate mode </b> via the pencil icon. The most reliable way to solve these puzzles is to look at a proposition individually and note down, broadly, what options it forces; repeating this, the options will gradually shrink until the answer becomes clear. </p>
