info= <p> If you haven't yet tried it, the plus button next to the grid allows you to create unlimited copies of the matrix. You can beat the level by completing any one of those matrices. It's useful for navigating different options simultaneously, but be aware that puzzles are foremost designed to be solved with candidate mode. </p>
