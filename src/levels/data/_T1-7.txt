info=<p>This is the last puzzle of the Propositions stage, good luck! It will only get more interesting from here as future levels introduce more logical abstractions.</p> <p> By reaching this level, you have unlocked a new feature: <span style="font-weight: 600"> matrix duplication</span>. Press the plus sign next to the grid to create a fresh copy of the matrix, or long press to create a copy starting from where you left off on the previous grid. You can switch between the matrices via scrolling left/right or the arrow keys. Solving any one of them will beat the level. Candidate mode is always intended to be the primary method by which you solve puzzles, but matrix duplication can help you explore different paths concurrently.</p>
