info= <p> Here you will see \(\to\) for the first time. Pronounced “implies,” it denotes that one proposition is contingent upon another. Thus \(p \to q\) is only false when \(p\) is true and \(q\) is false. It is important to see how this is unidirectional; if \(p\) is false, then the entire proposition is vacuously true. Intuitively, this is like a promise. Consider someone who says “If you pay me, I promise I will dance.” If they are not paid, they would not be breaking their promise if they still danced; the statement would only be false if they took the money and ran. </p>
