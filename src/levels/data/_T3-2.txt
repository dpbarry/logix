info=<p>Your first puzzle without any numbers... This level introduces the universal quantifier, \(\forall\) (read “for all”). It dictates that the variable it binds can stand for <i>any</i> member of the domain of discourse. For example, in the domain of natural numbers, \(\forall x : x \geq 0 \) represents the fact that any given natural number is greater than or equal to zero.</p>
